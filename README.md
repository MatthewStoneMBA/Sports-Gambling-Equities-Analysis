## Data Gathering & Scope

Having access to equities data with the R package TidyQuant (hyperlink), I analyzed each of these major stocks â€“ specifically the trading volume of each stock. I created a 2-week forecast for trading volume and compared the forecasts. In this analysis I conducted EDA, identifying seasonality and trends with Decomposition (fpp3 package (hyperlink)), and created a function that identifies the best fitting model for each individual stocks. The best fitting models were ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and ETS (Exponential Smoothing) for each stocks respectively. DraftKings and MGM Resorts had the highest forecasted trade volume, while FanDuel and CZR Entertainment had the lowest trading volume.
